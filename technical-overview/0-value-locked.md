# ðŸ”¥ 0 Value Locked

Total Value Locked (TVL) is a metric common used in crypto to represent the number of assets that are held within a specific protocol. In relation to DEXâ€™s, TVL refers to the total value of all digital assets that have been deposited into the exchange for the purpose of providing liquidity. The higher the TVL, the deeper and more liquid the markets are. At the same time, TVL signals confidence and utility in the protocol, and is ubiquitously used as a success metric.



Because of money streams, along with the ZILMM design, Aqueduct can operate with 0 total value locked. This dramatically increases capital efficiency and unlocks new possibilities for liquidity provision. For more information, see our resources on Superfluid liquidity and our ZILMM page.
