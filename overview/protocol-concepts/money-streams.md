# Money streams

A money stream is a flow of money that moves every second, at a specified flow-rate between accounts with no capital lock up. For example, Alice starts a stream of 10 DAI per second to Bob. Aliceâ€™s balance will decrease every second by 10 DAI, and Bobs balance will increase by 10 DAI every second.
