# Superfluid Liquidity

Superfluid Liquidity is a form of liquidity enabled by money streams that flows continuously. This is in contrast to conventional liquidity, that is transferred if and when needed, and is normally sitting in one place and state. Superfluid liquidity behaves in a similar way to how a real superfluid does. A fluid that is superfluid has zero viscosity and continues to flow without any loss of kinetic energy. All liquidity that enters Aqueduct behaves in a similar way and does not stop. It is this property of streams that make non-intermediate-liquidity possible.

This permits LPs to provide the same liquidity to multiple pools at the same time, leading to more efficient liquidity provision. This would mean a smaller number of LPs could serve a larger volume of liquidity on Aqueduct, compared to the same number for a traditional DEX that requires users to deposit tokens into one pool at a time.
