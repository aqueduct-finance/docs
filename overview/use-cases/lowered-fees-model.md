# üçÉ Fragmented Liquidity

Token pairs with fragmented liquidity are token pairs that have most of their liquidity separated in small amounts across more than one exchange. For traders or DAOs looking to buy or sell these tokens, doing so will be difficult without having significant price impact.

### Aqueduct as a Decentralized Aggregator

Aqueduct will effectively allow the purchase or sale of these assets over time with a drastic reduction in price impact. Since swaps on Aqueduct take place over time, arbitragers can source liquidity across DeFi to fix discrepancies in price from the market and Aqueduct. This brings the trader's swap back to the market price while allowing them to trade on liquidity sourced from DEXs across the ecosystem.

Arbitrageurs benefit from the arbitrage opportunity while the trader gets access to liquidity across DeFi, increasing their output in comparison to an instant swap on a DEX.

### Off-Loading or Re-Purchase of DAO Tokens

DAOs that want to buy-back or sell their native tokens will often run into the issue of fragmented liquidity. Depending on the size of the DAO and the popularity/underlying value of the token, a majority of the tokens are likely to be spread across many different exchanges.&#x20;

Here's an example of trying to buy one million USDC worth of $ARB on CoW swap.

Aqueduct's TWAMM will solve this type of price impact problem by allowing the trade to take place over time where arbitrageurs can fix the price, sourcing liquidity from elsewhere.\
