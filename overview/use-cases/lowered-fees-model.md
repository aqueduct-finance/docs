# ðŸŽ‰ Lowered Fees Model

According to the protocol, swaps and LP streams are equililent in the sense that both are treated as liquidity. Of course, the main difference being that a swap is a one token stream while an LP is two tokens simultaneously streaming in and out.

## Swappers as LPs

Swaps and LP positions serve the same functionality, therefore the need for LPs, is in theory negated if sufficient volume is provided for a token pair from swaps alone.&#x20;

Therefore, if swappers are providing enough per-second liquidity to Aqueduct to keep the pool balanced - liquidity providers are no longer needed. This unlocks the potential for the protocol to completely phaseout liquidity providers, and thus, drastically reduce fees for swapping. Price discovery would be done through arbitragers, who would still profit from their trades.\

Without LPs taking fees, the fees traders pay could reach values close to 0.0%, instead of 0.3%.\
