# ðŸ’¸ Stream Payments

Because transactions typically move value in a one-and-done fashion, on-chain recurring payments become manual and less scalable. Superfluid money streams solve this by allowing value to move perpetually and automatically between accounts.&#x20;

## Full composability&#x20;

Because [SuperTokens](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/super-tokens) cannot be exchanged in a streaming native way, the SuperToken ecosystem could be described as a collection pseudo walled gardens. Say you're an employee for a DAO that's based out of the US, but you live in the UK. You get paid in a stream of USDC, but you usually prefer to use a different currency. Your only option is to take your per second salary of USDC and perform a discrete transaction whenever you want to use your funds.\
\
With Aqueduct, you can simply convert your salary stream and get an equivalent per second stream of your preferred token. This means for the first time, SuperTokens can be used as a streaming-native medium of exchange in the real-time economy. Aqueduct breaks down the "walled gardens" of different SuperTokens, and allows value to flow freely, making the transfer of money through streams fully composable.&#x20;
