# Stream Payments

Because transactions typically move value in a one-and-done fashion, on-chain recurring payments become manual and less scalable. Superfluid money streams solve this by allowing value to move perpetually and automatically between accounts.&#x20;

## The Problem

Say you're an employee for a DAO that's based out of the US, but you live in the UK. You get paid in a stream of USDC, but you usually prefer to use a different currency. Your only option is to take your per second salary of USDC and perform a discrete transaction whenever you want to use your funds.\
\
With Aqueduct, you can simply stream in your salary and get an equivalent per second stream of your preferred token. Aqueduct acts as a medium of exchange for the real-time economy, making the transfer of money through streams fully composable.
