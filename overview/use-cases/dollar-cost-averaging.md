# ðŸ’µ Dollar Cost Averaging

**What is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)?** - Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of the asset's price. This approach to investing aims to reduce the impact of market volatility on the investment.

Because swaps on Aqueduct take place on a per-second basis, users get a perfect average of their preferred asset over the given amount of time their swap takes place over.

## Why use Aqueduct for DCA ?

Through conventional methods, Dollar Cost Averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money into a chosen asset at regular intervals. The intervals could be daily, weekly or monthly, instead of investing a lump sum all at once. By spreading the investment over time, the investor can potentially benefit from buying at different prices and reducing the impact of short/medium term price fluctuations.

Aqueduct improves upon this model by investing funds on a per second basis instead of daily, weekly, monthly, etc... Say you want to invest 1,000 USDC into ETH over a months time - with Aqueduct, you can start a stream of 1,000 USDC per month. This will effectively give the user a per second price of ETH from the user's start time to a month in the future.

Current DCA tools automate recurring transactions over a given interval of time. This of course leads to higher gas fees every time a transaction is automated while also creating a less capital efficient DCA tool. Aqueduct improves upon this concept by only requiring a single transaction to initiate, and continue executing the trade.&#x20;

Traders also get reduced price impact and low trading fees through decentralized aggregation and on-chain coincidence of wants. Retail investors looking to DCA can benefit by retaining most of their value and getting the per-second price of an asset. Every second DCA is achieved while users pay a fixed gas rate and retain most of their value.

Dollar cost averaging on Aqueduct's TWAMM also makes sense for institutional investing, learn more [here](../../use-cases/institutional-dca.md).
