# ðŸ’µ Dollar Cost Averaging

Because swaps on Aqueduct take place on a per-second basis, users get a perfect average of their preferred asset over the given amount of time their swap takes place over.\

**What is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)?** - Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of the asset's price. This approach to investing aims to reduce the impact of market volatility on the investment.

## Why use Aqueduct for DCA ?

Through conventional methods, Dollar Cost Averaging involves investing a fixed amount of money into a chosen asset at regular intervals. The intervals could be daily, weekly or monthly. Instead of investing a lump sum all at once. By spreading the investment over time, the investor can potentially benefit from buying at different prices and reducing the impact of short/medium term price fluctuations.

Aqueduct improves upon this model by investing funds on a per second basis instead of daily, weekly, monthly, etc... Say you want to invest 1000 USDC into ETH over a months time, with Aqueduct, you can start a stream of 1000 USDC per month. This will effectively give the user a per second price of ETH from the users start time to a month in the future.

By using Aqueduct, users will be able to benefit from the most capital efficient dollar cost averaging tool on the market, as trades are being made every second. Current DCA tools automate recurring transactions over a given interval of time. This of course leads to higher gas fees every time a transaction is automated while also creating a less capital efficient DCA tool. Aqueduct improves upon this concept by only requiring a single transaction to initiate, and continue executing the trade. The funds are then exchanged in real-time on a per-second basis, dramatically increasing capital efficiency. The key benefits here are: **TODO**
