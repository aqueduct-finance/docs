# Foreign Asset Fluctuation Resistance

Current subscription models require a discrete transaction to take place every time a payment is due for a service or product. Superfluid Finance improved on this concept by allowing a customer to pay for a product or service on a per second basis where the subscription stays active as long as the users stream stays active.

## The Problem

DAOs that create subscription from across the globe will often have to deal in assets that are not ideal, in the sense that the DAO will have to issue currency for expenses in a given currency. For example, if a DAO mainly has expenses in USDC but they take subscription payments from across the globe, they'll be forced to do a discrete transaction every time they get payment from a user that uses a different currency than the one the DAO prefers.

This can lead to losses for the DAO in that the asset the user pays in may fluctuate in comparison to the DAOs home asset.&#x20;

## The Solution - Aqueduct

With Aqueduct, a user could pay for a subscription in any asset they like while the DAO gets paid in their preferred asset.&#x20;

For example, Netflix takes subscriptions from users all across the globe in many different types of currencies. Most of Netflixs expenses are paid in USD, therfore, the company has to convert the currency they're paid in to the currency they need.\
\
With this model, Netflix becomes fully susceptible to foreign asset fluctuation. If the price of the users home asset fluctuates in comparison to USD during the month that their subscription is active through, the amount of USD Netflix gets from the users payment could be less then initially accounted for.\
\
If Netflix accepted streams as a form of payment, Aqueduct could curb the affects of foreign asset fluctuation by distributing the assets fluctuation over the life of the subscription. Instead of a direct loss, Netflix would get a dollar cost averaged allocation of USD in comparison to the users asset throughout the life of the subscription.
