# üîê Enforce Lockup

NOTE: All token lockups are created using Hedgey smart contracts. If you have an active token lockup, visit [https://app.hedgey.finance/](https://app.hedgey.finance/).

### Choose your unlock frequency

We support three types of unlock frequencies, including linear, periodic, and single. The details of each are shown below.

#### Linear

If you choose linear, the tokens will be allocated to the counterparty over the given lockup period at a linear rate. Just specify the start date, lockup period, and cliff.

#### Periodic

Periodic unlock frequency is the same as linear, except you decide the frequency in which the counterparty receives the tokens over a given lockup period. You can choose between daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

#### Single

Single unlock frequency means the tokens will fully vest at a given date. Simply enter time period you'd like to give for the tokens to fully vest.

### Click "Submit Order"

At this point of the swap process, you may be asked to sign token approvals for the tokens you're trading. This simply gives us the ability to send your tokens to your counterparty when they execute the trade.

You may also have to sign token approvals for the Hedgey lockup contract.

If you have already approved tokens, you should see a sign trade modal. Simply click the "Sign message in wallet" button to create your trade.

Once the you sign the transaction, you should see a confirmation message that says "Trade Signed." Click View / edit order to view order details and copy the link to your trade.

### Share the link with your counterparty

Once your link has been copied, share it with your counterparties. This trade is not restricted, so any counterparty will be able to fill it.

### Counterparty view

Once your counterparty opens the link, they should see a page that looks like the one below.

### Accepting the vesting schedule

Once the counterparty clicks "Buy fWBTC" in this example, they will be prompted to accept the vesting schedule. Once accepted and the trade is signed, they will be able to view their token lockup in the Hedgey dashboard.
