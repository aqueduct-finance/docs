### Click "Allow partial fills"

Click the "Allow partial fills" button in the "Options" modal. This will enable counterparties to fill fractions of the total trade if they choose to do so.\
\
**IMPORTANT**: You may select "Restrict trade" in addition to "Allow partial fills." If you choose to do so, you will be able to add wallet addresses who are permitted to fill the trade after the order is created. You will also be able to specify min and max fill amounts for your restricted counterparties. \
\
For this walkthrough, we won't be restricting the trade. If you would like to restrict the partial fill and need any assistance, please contact us at blaine@aqueductfinance.com.

### Click "Submit Order"

At this point of the swap process, you may be asked to sign token approvals for the tokens you're trading. This simply gives us the ability to send your tokens to your counterparty when they execute the trade.

If you have already approved tokens, you should see a sign trade modal. Simply click the "Sign message in wallet" button to create your trade.
