# Lowered Fees Model

&#x20;Swaps on Aqueduct and liquidity positions serve similar functionality in that they both are a stream in and out of the protocol. Of course, the main difference being that a swap is a one token stream while an LP is two tokens simultaneously streaming in and out.

## Swappers as LPs

Swaps and LP positions serve the same functionality, therefor the need for LPs is negated if enough volume of streams for a token pair is coming from swaps alone.&#x20;

Through this, if swappers are providing enough per-second liquidity to Aqueduct to keep the pool balanced - liquidity providers are no longer needed. There exists the potential for the protocol to completely faze out liquidity providers and thus, drastically reduce fees for swapping.\
\
Without LPs to accept fees, the original model of 0.3% fees can be reduced to something closer to 0.0%.\
