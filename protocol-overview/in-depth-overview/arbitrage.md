# ðŸ’µ Arbitrage

In order to facilitate efficient price discovery, Aqueduct will rely on arbitrageurs to exploit price discrepancies across Aqueductâ€™s pools and other money markets. Traditionally, arbitrageurs on AMMs benefit from the atomic nature of transactions to execute a trade, and take profit in the same transaction, leading to riskless arbitrage (not counting the competition from frontrunners). As Aqueduct swaps occur over time as prices move, the price you get for an asset will change depending on the ratio of incoming pool assets. This means arbitragers take on additional risk when compared to a discrete AMM.
