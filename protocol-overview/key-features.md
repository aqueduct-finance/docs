# ðŸ”‘ Key Features

## A New Standard

Aqueduct brings new functionality to DeFi that improve on the inefficiencies of the current common exchange structure.&#x20;

**One Transaction DCA** - Swaps on Aqueduct take place per second where the amount swapped per second is specified by the users chosen flow rate. Normal DCA tools and strategies require recurring discrete transactions over a given period of time to "average" the users position. With Aqueduct, a single transaction is made and a per second stream of one token to another is started.

**0 Value Locked** - Assets streamed into the protocol are streamed out simultaneously. Funds are constantly streamed in and out of the protocol, no tokens are ever held by Aqueduct. Liquidity Providers have immediate access to their tokens - any liquidity streamed in is immediately streamed out and back in until the position is liquidated. LPs now have the opportunity to gain yield from their positions whilst simultaneously participating in any other protocol they choose.

**Superfluid Liquidity** - Superfluid Liquidity is __ a form of liquidity enabled by money streams that does not stop moving. Similar to how a real superfluid has zero viscosity and continues to flow without any loss of kinetic energy â€” Superfluid liquidity never stops. It is this characteristic that powers the 0 TVL architecture of Aqueduct. All liquidity that flows into the pool has to flow out, unlocking new possibilities for liquidity provision.\
\
**MEV Resistance** - Money streams enabled bye Superfluid are not restricted by the order of transactions that take place within a block. Therefor, direct MEV attacks have no affect on a users stream. A user is still susceptible to slippage and price impact - however, the longer a swap is active, the less the effect of price impact within a single block.
