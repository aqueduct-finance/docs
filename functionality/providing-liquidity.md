# ðŸš° Providing Liquidity

A liquidity provider (LP) will deposit a proportionate amount of both token A and token B, so as to maintain the previous ratio of liquidity.

Liquidity providing on Aqueduct's TWAMM works the exact same as any other AMM except fees are distributed to LPs from both discrete and time-based swaps. Fee allocation is based on total liquidity supplied and the total volume of the token pair on Aqueduct at any given time.

Providing liquidity on Aqueduct is a familiar experience for any LP that has provided liquidity on AMMs like Uniswap V2.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Since Aqueduct supports the settlement of coincidence of wants, the total volume of a token pair may not be indicative of the total fees distributed to LPs.
