# Swaps

**2.** Navigate to the _"Wrap / Unwrap"_ page. Select the amount of tokens you want to upgrade and click _"Wrap"_. You'll need to approve two transactions for this action, one to approve the Aqueduct smart contracts to access your tokens, and the second to actually upgrade those tokens.

**3.** Then navigate back to the _"Swap"_ page. Enter the flow-rate you want to swap the token at. You can choose a per-second flow-rate or anywhere up to per-year flow-rate. Then click on the _"Swap"_ button to initiate the swap. **Note:** _You will need to provide a small buffer to initiate the swap._
