# Providing Liquidity



1. Head to [https://aqueductfinance.vercel.app/](https://aqueductfinance.vercel.app/) and connect your wallet.
2. Navigate to the _"Wrap / Unwrap"_ page. You will need both tokens in a token pair to provide liquidity. Select the amount of tokens you want to upgrade and click _"Wrap"_. You'll need to approve two transactions for this, one to approve the Aqueduct smart contracts to access your tokens, and the second to actually upgrade those tokens. Repeat the steps again for the second token.
3. Then navigate to the _"Provide Liquidity"_ page. Enter the flow-rate you want to provide liquidity for both tokens at. You can choose a per-second flow-rate or anywhere up to per-year flow-rate. Then click on the _"Update Position"_ button to start providing liquidity. **Note:** _You will need to provide a small buffer of each token to initiate the swap._
4. Finally, visit the _"My Streams"_ page to view your active streams.
