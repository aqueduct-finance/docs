# üêô DAO Treasury

DAOs with large sums of tokens in their treasury may benefit from swapping these assets over time. Portfolio diversification is important for any organization looking to mitigate the risk of holding a few tokens in their treasury. If a large portion of a DAO's treasury is held in just a few tokens, the collapse of one of those tokens could lead to the DAO losing massive amounts of capital. A way for DAOs to mitigate theses risks is to hold their treasury in several different tokens, using a TWAMM to slowly swap assets whenever they need to do so.

The alternative to this is doing a manual TWAP, which will cost the DAO loads in unnecessary gas costs and slippage from inefficient exchange services. With Aqueduct's TWAMM, DAOs can effectively reduce the risk of exchanging large sums of money all at one time and potentially benefit from changing market conditions.

DAOs looking to offload large amounts of capital in the form of their native currency will need to do so over time in order to reduce price impact and market fluctuations. Aqueduct's TWAMM is the best place to execute these types of orders on-chain.

### Retain Value

Decentralized aggregation, automated on-chain settlement of coincidence of wants, and reduced immediate impact on the whole market all attribute to the fact that DAOs will retain more value on Aqueduct than any other method of exchange.&#x20;

Reduced price impact and fees from these features of Aqueduct's TWAMM are made possible with liquidity that is orders of magnitude less than the largest DEXs on the market through arbitrage. As TVL on Aqueduct increases, the value retained and efficiency of trades will only get better.

### Improve Transparency

DAOs may choose to hold or trade assets on centralized exchanges to avoid the inefficiencies of trading large sums of money on decentralized exchanges. While this may help save the DAO some value, the reliance on a centralized entity and lack of transparency within the decentralized ecosystem will have a negative affect on the DAOs decision. A reliance on CEX also exposes the DAO to counterparty risk, take the situation of FTX as an example.

Aqueduct's TWAMM allows for DAOs to keep decentralized transparency while retaining the same value an over the counter trade would allow for.&#x20;
