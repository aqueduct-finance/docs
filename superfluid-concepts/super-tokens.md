# 🏋♂ Super Tokens

The Super Token is an extension of the ERC20 token standard that plugs into the Superfluid Protocol to include Super Agreement abilities. These Super Agreements allow Super Tokens to be moved in powerful ways such as in streams or instant distributions.

All tokens on Aqueduct must already exist as a super token or be wrapped into a super token. Wrapping can either be done manually or through [off-chain automation](https://docs.superfluid.finance/superfluid/developers/automations/auto-wrap).
